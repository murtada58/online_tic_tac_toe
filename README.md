# online_tic_tac_toe

A simple online tic tac toe game made to learn a bit more about sockets and networking

Currently this has only been made to work for 2 clients and the server will not work properly if the clients dont disconnect correctly (you need to close the pygame window instead of ctrl+C)

If a client disconnects mid play it could also cause issues with game state so both clients will have to disconnect and reconnect to reset the game state

A future version will be built with a lobby system and possibly secure authentiction when I learn a bit more about security
